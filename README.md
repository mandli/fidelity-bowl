# Multi-Fidelity Bowl-Radial Test Case

Test case for multi-fidelity stochastic parameter representation based on the
bowl-radial GeoClaw example.

To run the base model and create the plots run the command
> make .plots

If you want to run the full ensemble run
> ./run_ensemble.py

Note that this later command requires the repository at

https://github.com/mandli/batch 

and is specific to the Habanero cluster at Columbia University.
